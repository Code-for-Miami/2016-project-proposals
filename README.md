### Proposal submission deadline is May 23rd.

## Wondering how to propose or discuss your project ideas?

[GitHub Issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/) works just like any other commenting system on the Internet. 

First, you'll need to [create an account](https://github.com/join). 

Then you have two options: (1) comment on an existing idea (a.k.a. "issue"), or (2) create a new idea.

If you see an idea that you're interested in, click on it, read the discussion and then add your thoughts to the bottom of the discussion thread. If you don't see the idea you have in mind, [add a new one](https://github.com/open-austin/atx-hack-for-change-2016/issues/new). Someone from the ATX Hack for Change Staff will respond with some questions or feedback. 

*Here's a [quick video intro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlrJVSJRUN4) on using Github Issues for discussion.*

## I've submitted my proposal. What comes next?

After May 8th, the project curation committee (which includes representatives from St. Edwards University, Open Austin, and the City of Austin Innovation Office) will follow up with potential project champions. 

Finalist projects will be announced on May 27. All registered ATX Hack for Change participants will receive the announced projects and challenges. Additionally, at the Friday, June 3rd kickoff event, the final projects listing will be available in print for those that might have missed it.
