## How To Propose or Discuss Project Ideas

[GitHub Issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/) work just like any other commenting system on the Internet. First, you'll need to [create an account](https://github.com/join). Then you have two options: (1) comment on an existing idea (a.k.a. "issue"), or (2) create a new idea.

If you see an idea that you're interested in, click on it, read the discussion, and then add your thoughts to the bottom of the discussion thread. If you don't see the idea you have in mind, [add a new one](https://github.com/code4sac/projects/issues/new). You'll need a title and description and we encourage you to use the Template below. Then, someone from the Open Austin Core Team will respond, likely with some questions or feedback. 

GitHub is the platform we're using to collect ideas, vet ideas, and convert those ideas into active projects. Once a project becomes active, a new *repository* on GitHub will be created where all subsequent conversations about that project will live. We'll continue to use the Issues feature to flag obstacles, opportunities, and answer questions about that specific project.
